/**
 * The main menu's colours and live badges, pure (the menu that draws them is views/menu.ts). Each group has an accent: its border, a
 * solid title bar and its key chips are drawn in it, the way a BBS menu set its sections apart. The colours are from the xterm
 * 256-colour cube and grey ramp (so they render the same where a terminal has no truecolor, and in tmux), and the ink on an accent
 * has contrast enough to read: tests/menu-style.spec.ts checks both. An entry also carries a badge when there is something to say
 * about it (approvals waiting, a mission under way, findings, an update), from the same facts the band above the prompt reads; an
 * entry with nothing to say gets none, never a zero.
