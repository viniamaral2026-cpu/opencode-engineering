/**
 * A goal-oriented action planner (GOAP) over the SPARC method. The world is a set of facts (specified, architected,
 * tested, ...); an action has preconditions, effects and a cost; the planner finds the cheapest action sequence that
 * reaches the goal's facts with A*, then reads the task graph off the preconditions (an action depends on the actions
 * that produced the facts it needs), so independent branches (pseudocode beside architecture) are parallel. The goal
 * changes with the kind of work (profile) and how thorough it must be (rigor), so a lean bug fix and a thorough security
 * change plan differently from the same action library. Pure: no I/O, deterministic for the same input.
 *
 * Every mission follows one lifecycle, whatever the work: Research, Create (specification, design, ADRs and the SOP), Build,
 * Test, Validate, Secure, Benchmark, Learn (the outcome is stored and the router and neural patterns trained, so the next
 * mission starts better). Lean drops the middle stages; standard and thorough run them all. Underneath, SPARC phases order the work:
 *
 * SPARC phases: S specification, P pseudocode, A architecture, R refinement (tests first, then the change), C completion
 * (integrate, document, verify); X is a cross-cutting gate (review, security review, benchmark).
