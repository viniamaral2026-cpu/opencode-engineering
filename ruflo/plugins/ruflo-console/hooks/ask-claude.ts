/**
 * "Ask Claude about this" for every section: the view's own text (the same words `/ruflo dump <view>` prints) goes to the primary
 * Claude Code session as a visible prompt, or as a `/btw` aside, with a question. It starts a model turn, so it asks first with the
 * exact text; mid-turn it only fills the prompt box. The screen's lines are sent as quoted data (every line behind `│`, so none can
 * begin a slash command), secrets are redacted first, a typed question is screened by AIDefence, and the terminal and Settings views
 * share nothing (a conversation, setting values). A view may also offer the slash command of a ruflo plugin that fits it, when the
 * session lists that command.
