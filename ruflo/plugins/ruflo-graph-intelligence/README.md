# ruflo-graph-intelligence

Graph Intelligence Engine for RuFlo: single-entry personalized PageRank, streaming delta updates and witness-signed reasoning artifacts (ADR-123), built on sublinear-time-solver. Library: `npm test`, `npm run build`.

## As a mod (0.2.0-alpha.4)

A function-hook mod ships beside the skills (ADR-445 pattern). Needs a Claude Code with mods (2.1.287+); older builds ignore it. No network, no process spawning: it only tightens calls to this plugin's own tools and reads through tools already connected.

| Piece | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Write guard** | on | Refuses a call to a `sublinear/*` (`sublinear_*`) tool whose input holds a key, token or password: graph, node and seed ids land in signed artifacts that federation can copy. |
| **`/graph-mod`** | — | `status`, `scan <text>`, `tools` (lists connected graph-intelligence tools); answered locally, no model call. |
| **Status file** | — | `.claude-flow/graph-mod/status.json` (`version`, `updatedMs`, mode flags and counters); written at session start and when a counter changes. |

Options (`userConfig`): `guard` on\|off. Refusals never echo the value they matched.

```bash
bash plugins/ruflo-graph-intelligence/scripts/smoke.sh   # stages the mod and runs claude plugin test (7 tests); the engine's own tests: npm test
```
