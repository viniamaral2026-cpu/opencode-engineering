/**
 * Which classic hook-handler events this mod takes over, so no event fires
 * twice (ADR-404, "One owner per event").
 *
 * The mod owns an event when no classic hook for it is configured, or when the
 * configured hook-handler.cjs honours the handshake: the mod sets
 * `RUFLO_MODS_OWNS` in the process environment, every settings hook started
 * after inherits it, and hook-handler.cjs returns early for an event named
 * there. A helper too old to know the handshake would run anyway, so the mod
 * stands down for that event and the classic hook keeps it.
 *
 * Only side-effect events are ever owned. `pre-bash` is a guard: the mod's
 * `tool.check` and the classic hook both refuse the same commands, a second
 * refusal changes nothing, and a forged handshake must never switch a guard
 * off. Session restore and end stay classic (intelligence init/consolidate
 * need Node).
