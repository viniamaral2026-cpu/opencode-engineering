 * `session.receive` and `session.send` (ADR-451 item 3): an in-process
 * pattern screen for what reaches the session from a peer or relay, and for
 * what leaves it for another agent. Off unless `deliveryScreen` is on.
 *
 * Tighten-only: an inbound hit is consumed (nothing is queued, shown or read
 * by the model), an outbound hit is refused; text is never rewritten and never
 * allowed past another hook's refusal (the screen only answers without `next`
 * on a hit). The person's own prompts (Remote Control, scheduled triggers) and
 * the lead's messages are not screened. The rule id is named, never the
 * matched text. Any failure passes the message on.
