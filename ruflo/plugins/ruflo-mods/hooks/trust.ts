 * The mod trust gate (ADR-404). Claude Code can now write, install and
 * hot-reload a mod mid-session, and a mod runs with Claude Code's own access.
 * A user-tier hook on `plugin.register` judges every hooks module admitted
 * after it (and every reload), reading what the host scanned the module to
 * use; it may answer `{ refuse }`. This gate names what a module could do and,
 * only when the person opts in, refuses user-tier modules that can do the
 * risky things below. It reads the scan, never the module's own claims.
 *
 * What it cannot do: judge modules admitted before it (the host orders
 * admission), or any prepend/append/builtin module (the organization's and
 * Claude Code's own, out of a person's reach by design).
