# Index: the mod-system ADRs (404 to 453)

Checked 2026-10-05 against `main` at 6c7b6e889. "PR" is the merged pull request that added the ADR file (found with `gh api repos/ruvnet/ruflo/commits/<sha>/pulls`); "Shipped in" is the version the ADR's own status line names, confirmed against the `version` in the plugin's `plugin.json` at the commit that added the ADR or its code. "Tests" are test files the ADR names or that the commit implementing it added (console tests are in `plugins/ruflo-console/tests/`, `.spec.ts` unless noted). `—` means the ADR does not say. `node scripts/check-adr-links.mjs` checks the links, the relation lines and the numbering of the 4xx files.

Two files carry the number 430 (the menu's accents, and the menu-design amendments); `scripts/check-adr-links.mjs` allows exactly that pair.

Other ADRs outside 404-451 that the mod ADRs lean on: 150 (removable integrations), 174 (failures as a learning signal), 322 and 322A/B/C (flywheel, evaluation and promotion, receipts), 324 and 325 (policy engine, claims plane), 103 (witness). The console's Mods section (`hooks/data/mods.ts`, console 0.33.1, PR #3707) reads the status files ADR 446 defines.

## Notes

- **Dates.** ADRs 444, 445 and 446 were dated 2026 10 05 but were committed on 2026-10-04 (14:36 -0400, merged 19:24 UTC); corrected. ADR 450 is still dated 2026 10 05 in its own header although its file was added on 2026-10-04 (7725b867f); the owner should fix the file.
- **ADR 405 and 406** still read "Proposed" although parts shipped (ruflo-ruos 0.1.0 for 405; mission records and the console for 406, which accepted ADRs 408, 409 and 443 build on). Their owners should decide whether to mark them Accepted with the unbuilt parts split out; this index does not change them.
- **Forward links.** 449, 450 and 451 are on `main`. 447 names all three as followers. They do not yet cite each other: 449 cites 404, 446, 447 but not 450 or 451; 450 cites 444 to 448 but not 449 or 451; 451 cites 445 to 447 but not 449 or 450; 452 cites 450 and 451. As of this update 450 and 451 name 449 and 452 and each other in a `Related`/`Builds on` line; 449 still does not name 450 or 451 (not edited here).
- **ADR files whose own Status line differs from this index:** none for 450 and 451, whose Status lines now carry the same implementation summary (section 9 of 450, section 8 of 451 hold the tables). 405, 406 and 449 are "Proposed" in both.
- **ADRs with no stated parent:** 434, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440, 441 carry no `Builds on` or `Extends` line.
