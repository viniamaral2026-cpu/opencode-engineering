/**
 * Delivery gate (#267): ask the model what it received, never the logs.
 *
 * Every check the template had confirmed that a hook RAN. None confirmed what
 * ARRIVED, and from Claude Code 2.1.89 to the #254 fix, hook output past
 * 10,000 characters reached the model as a 2,000-character preview while
 * every log said success. The mod moves the session context to a channel
 * (an instruction file) on a young API, so the same failure is possible
 * again. This gate runs real Claude Code sessions in throwaway vaults and, at
 * each checkpoint, asks the model to quote two things from the context it was
 * given: its LAST line (the injection meter), and a marker token placed in a
 * brain note in its MIDDLE. A context cut anywhere loses one of them.
 *
 *  - with the mod: at startup, in a session of its own; then in a second
 *    session after `/compact`, from a general-purpose subagent straight after
 *    `/clear`, and after a second `/clear`;
 *  - without the mod (the settings hooks alone): at startup, after `/compact`
 *    and after `/clear`. The hook path's context is held under the hook cap by
 *    the template itself, so there it collapses the brain index to a pointer
 *    and only the last line is asked for.
 *
 * With the mod, each `/compact` and `/clear` first changes the fixture: one
 * more brain note moves the delivered size, and the marker is rewritten. So
 * the context delivered afterwards ends with a size, and carries a marker,
 * that nobody has quoted yet: neither a compaction summary nor an earlier
 * answer can supply them, only a fresh delivery can.
 *
 * Only the stream decides, and every other road an answer could take is
 * closed in the judge, not in the prompt. A checkpoint is INVALID, never PASS,
 * when: its turn used a tool; the `/compact` summary carried the new size or
 * marker, or could not be read; a `/compact` or `/clear` left no event of its
 * own; the subagent was not a general-purpose one, was handed the size or
 * marker in its prompt, used tools, or did not report its tool count; with the
 * mod, the settings hook printed the context instead of standing down (or,
 * without it, printed nothing); or the session errored, timed out, ran an
 * extra turn or ended early.
 *
 * Run it by hand on any Claude Code version before it is recommended, with a
 * logged-in `claude`:
 *
 *   node --experimental-strip-types .github/scripts/delivery-gate.ts [--trusted-dir <dir>] [--file-issue] [--model opus] [--claude <bin>]
 *
 * `--trusted-dir` loads the mod the way a user gets it: found in the vault's
 * `.claude/skills/` after the workspace-trust prompt, which a headless session
 * cannot accept. Give it an empty folder you have opened once in Claude Code
 * and trusted; the gate builds each session's vault in that exact folder
 * (trust does not extend to subfolders) and empties it afterwards. Without it,
 * the mod is loaded with `--plugin-dir` from a temp-folder vault.
 *
 * `--file-issue` opens a GitHub issue (with `gh`) when a checkpoint fails.
 *
 * `--self-test` runs two broken copies of the mod instead: one cuts its
 * context to 2,000 characters everywhere, one delivers it whole only at
 * startup. Every checkpoint must FAIL, except the startup-only copy's own
 * startup, which must PASS (the control that proves that copy delivered).
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 pass (with `--self-test`: the gate can fail); 1 a checkpoint
 * did not receive the current context (with `--self-test`: the gate is
 * broken); 2 the run could not be judged. A FAIL wins over an INVALID, and in
 * the self-test so does any PASS against a broken mod.
 *
 * It costs model turns on the caller's account, and it is not wired to CI: a
 * public repository's CI has no credentials to give it.
