/**
 * Claiming a filename without losing a write.
 *
 * Extracted because both write paths — memories and work records — need it, and
 * a correctness-critical pattern implemented twice is a fix applied once.
 *
 * WHY NOT check-then-write
 *
 * The obvious version is `while (existsSync(x)) bump(x); writeFileSync(x)`. It
 * is a TOCTOU race, and not a theoretical one: the deployment shape is one
 * server process PER CONSUMING REPO, all writing into one vault. Six processes
 * recording the same title produced FOUR files and SIX success messages — two
 * writes lost silently, reported as recorded, which is the worst outcome
 * available to a layer whose whole job is not losing them.
 *
 * `COPYFILE_EXCL` fails instead of clobbering, so the loser simply takes the
 * next suffix. The temp file also means a crash mid-write cannot leave a
 * half-written note for the indexer to pick up.
