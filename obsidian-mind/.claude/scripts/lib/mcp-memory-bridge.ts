/**
 * The seam between the memory core and the server.

 * platforms the caller belongs to, and how the index reorders what the
 * visibility rule already allowed.
 *
 * Everything here was the site of at least one real defect, and each is called

/**
 * Which platforms the calling repo belongs to.
 *
 * Read from the project's own note rather than from server config, so the answer
 * lives where a human would naturally maintain it and no vault has to learn a
 * second place to declare things. A project with no note, or no `platforms:`
 * key, simply has no platform, and platform-scoped memories will not reach it —
 * the correct default for "unknown".
 *
 * TWO WRONG VERSIONS PRECEDED THIS, both failing the same silent way.
 *
 * The first looked in `projects/<caller>/README.md`. That is one vault's shape;
 * a clean install of this template has no `projects/` folder at all. Config
 * would not have saved it either — a key that must be set correctly per vault
 * is the same assumption with extra steps.
 *
 * The second matched on note identity but walked the EXPOSED files only. A
 * vault that keeps its projects in a folder outside `mcp_exposed_roots` (the
 * default does exactly that) silently returned no platform, so every
 * platform-scoped memory was withheld. It was caught only because `explain`
 * printed `platforms=[]`.
 *
 * The fix is a boundary correction rather than a wider allowlist: what platform
 * the CALLER belongs to is a property of the caller, not of what the vault
 * chooses to expose as readable content. So the search is vault-wide by
 * FILENAME, exactly one frontmatter key is read from the single matching file,
 * no note body is used, and nothing is returned to the caller except its own
 * platform list.
 *
 * A THIRD version was nearly shipped and caught in review. Reading only the
 * head — as the other frontmatter probes in this file do — looks like the same
 * optimisation, but it is not: those replaced an equally-sized character slice,
 * while this replaced a WHOLE-file read. `parseFrontmatter` needs the CLOSING
 * `---`, so a project note whose frontmatter runs past the head (a long
 * description, or aliases, both ordinary) parsed to `{}` and the caller got no
 * platforms — presenting exactly like the two failures above. This reads the
 * whole file on purpose: it is one file per call, next to a vault walk.
