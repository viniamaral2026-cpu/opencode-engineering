/**
 * MEMORY.md generation (#125) — the auto-memory index as a DERIVED view.
 *
 * NOT the vault memory layer. This module builds Claude Code's local
 * `MEMORY.md` pointer index; `memory-write.ts` / `memory-recall.ts` are the
 * cross-repo vault memory reached over MCP. Two unrelated things were both
 * called "memory" until this file was renamed — the entry script keeps its
 * original name because it is quoted verbatim in `om-wrap-up.md` and pinned in
 * `vault-manifest.json`, and a rename there would break a documented command.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md doctrine: `~/.claude/.../memory/MEMORY.md` is an auto-loaded
 * index ONLY — pointers to brain/ topic notes, never content. The doctrine
 * only holds if the index is derivable: the moment authored knowledge
 * accumulates there, it forks the source of truth and silently desyncs
 * from the vault. This module makes it derivable — deterministic output
 * from brain/ sources, byte-for-byte reproducible, so nothing authored
 * can be lost on regeneration because nothing authored is permitted.
