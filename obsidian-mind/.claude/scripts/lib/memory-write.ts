 *
 * WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM A WORK RECORD
 *
 * A *work record* ("what I did in this repo today") is single-valued by nature:
 * it belongs to the project it happened in, and it is a log entry. A *memory*
 * ("a tsup-external dependency can't be fixed by a local patch") is multi-valued
 * by nature: it transfers, and its whole worth is that a session in a DIFFERENT
 * repo can find it. One tool for both would force a single shape on two
 * artifacts and lose the facets that make the second findable.
 *
 * The routing test, stated for the model in the tool description: *would this
 * help someone working in a different repo?*
