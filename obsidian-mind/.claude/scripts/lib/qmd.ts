/**
 * Cross-platform QMD invocation helpers.
 *
 * Bare `spawnSync("qmd", ...)` fails on Windows because npm installs qmd as a
 * .cmd/.ps1 shim that Node's spawn can't resolve without routing through the
 * platform shell — and even with `shell: true` the .cmd shim itself depends
 * on /bin/sh via %_prog%, which fails on stock Windows without Git Bash.
 *
 * Rather than scatter platform-conditional `shell: process.platform === "win32"`
 * flags across every qmd call, these helpers resolve @tobilu/qmd's real JS
 * entry and let callers spawn it with the current Node binary. No shell, no
 * shim, same code path on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
 *
 * Shared with `.claude/scripts/qmd-mcp.mjs` by duplicated implementation —
 * that file is .mjs (MCP servers run as their own entry), so it can't import
 * this .ts helper at Node's `--experimental-strip-types` runtime. The two
 * copies are asserted independently: `tests/qmd.test.ts` locks this file's
 * `resolveQmdEntry` + `buildQmdCommand` shape, and `tests/qmd-mcp.test.ts`
 * locks the .mjs wrapper's equivalents. Drift between the two shows up as
 * a test failure on the CI matrix rather than a silent platform bug.
