/**
 * The vault memory layer — retrieval.
 *
 * Deliberately a separate module from the write path. They have different
 * failure modes: a bad write costs one note, while a bad read puts another
 * project's context into this session and is acted on as if it applied. Keeping
 * them apart means the visibility rule can be reasoned about — and hammered —
 * alone.
 *
 * THE PRECISION PROBLEM
 *
 * Retrieval has two failure modes pulling in opposite directions:
 *
 *   false positive — a memory from an unrelated project surfaces. The expensive
 *                    one: it is how a session gets "reminded" of a constraint
 *                    that does not apply, and how one client's context reaches
 *                    another's.
 *   false negative — a memory that would have helped stays hidden. Cheap in
 *                    isolation, but it is the entire value proposition; a memory
 *                    layer nobody's session ever sees is an expensive no-op.
 *
 * The resolution: reach is DECLARED at write time (`scope`) rather than guessed
 * at read time. A reader never widens what a writer declared.
