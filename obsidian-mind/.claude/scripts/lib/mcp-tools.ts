/**
 * Tool declarations.
 *
 * These descriptions are not documentation — they are the ONLY thing the model
 * reads when deciding whether to call a tool, so they are written as
 * instructions to that decision rather than as summaries of behaviour. Two
 * measured lessons shape them:
 *
 * 1. A tool is skipped whenever a nearer source of the answer exists. So each
 *    description says WHEN to reach for it, not merely what it does.
 * 2. `remember` and `record_work` are constantly confused, and a store filling
 *    with "what I did today" is worse than an empty one. The distinction is
 *    stated as a TEST the model can apply ("would this help someone on a
 *    different project?") rather than as a definition.
 *
 * `annotations` let a client pick a tool without trial-and-error and let a
 * permission layer auto-approve the read-only ones. Omitting them was an
 * oversight in the first prototype.
