/**
 * `record_work` — filing what happened in a repo back into the vault.
 *
 * The sibling of `remember`, and constantly confused with it. The distinction
 * is single-valued vs multi-valued: a WORK RECORD is about one project at one
 * moment, so it has a correct folder and gets filed into it. A MEMORY may touch
 * several projects and a cross-cutting theme, so it has no correct folder and
 * lives under a date with its reach declared in frontmatter.
 *
 * ROUTING IS DELEGATED, NOT INFERRED
 *
 * The calling session already carries the vault's conventions (through the
 * injected contract) and can search the vault to see where similar notes live.
 * It is an agent the user is already paying for, so asking it to choose costs
 * nothing extra and beats anything this server could infer from a repo name.
 *
 * The server's job is therefore to VALIDATE, never to guess: a caller-supplied
 * folder must resolve inside an exposed root, so a destination string cannot
 * turn this tool into an arbitrary write anywhere on disk.
