/**
 * The project directory the calling agent gave a hook or script.
 *
 * Each agent names the project directory in its own variable: Claude Code
 * sets CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR; the Codex and Gemini configs pass
 * CODEX_PROJECT_DIR and GEMINI_PROJECT_DIR. The first non-empty one wins.
 * An empty value counts as unset (`||`, not `??`): an empty string is never
 * a usable root, and treating it as one resolved paths against "".
 *
 * The fallback is the caller's. Every hook passes the working directory.
 * The Codex and Gemini hook commands resolve their script through
 * `${*_PROJECT_DIR:-.}`, so there a hook only runs at all when the variable
 * or cwd names the vault root. The Claude commands walk up from
 * `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}` instead (below). Not to be confused with
 * qmd-refresh.ts's resolveVaultRoot, which ignores these variables on purpose
 * (a detached worker anchors to its own location), or with mcp-context.ts's,
 * which reads the MCP server's own vault-path override.
 *
 * The directory named is not always the vault root (#263). Claude Code sets
 * CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR to the folder the session was launched in and does not
 * update it on `/cd`, so a session started in a vault subfolder and moved to
 * the root with `/cd` loads the root's hooks while the variable still names
 * the subfolder. So the result walks up from the named directory to the
 * nearest one holding `vault-manifest.json`, and falls back to the named
 * directory itself when there is none above it (a script run outside a
 * vault keeps today's behaviour). The Claude hook commands do the same walk
 * in the shell, to find the script at all.
