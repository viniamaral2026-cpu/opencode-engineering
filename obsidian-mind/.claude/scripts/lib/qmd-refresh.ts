/**
 * Mid-session QMD refresh — pure predicates, spawn composition, and the
 * shared debounced-trigger flow. Consumed by the PostToolUse hook
 * (`.claude/scripts/qmd-refresh.ts`), the Stop hook
 * (`.claude/scripts/stop-checklist.ts`), and the detached worker
 * (`.claude/scripts/qmd-refresh-run.ts`). Centralizing the lifecycle
 * here guarantees both hook entries honor the same debounce contract
 * and spawn shape — the only way to drift is to bypass this module.
 *
 * The pure helpers at the top of this file (path filter, debounce math,
 * vault-root resolver, invocation composer) run identically on Windows,
 * macOS, and Linux and are exercised in the CI matrix without side
 * effects. The impure orchestration at the bottom (sentinel + spawn)
 * delegates platform-specific spawn shape to `lib/qmd.ts`.
