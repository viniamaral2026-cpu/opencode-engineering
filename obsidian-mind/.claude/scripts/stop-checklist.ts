/**
 * Conversation-boundary hook — the wrap-up checklist plus concrete
 * vault-hygiene findings, and a debounced QMD refresh so the next session
 * opens against a current index.
 *
 * Where it runs is decided by where its message can be seen (#252):
 *
 *  - Claude Code and Codex call it on Stop, which fires after EVERY
 *    response, not at the end of the session. An unconditional report there
 *    repeats unchanged drift on every turn, and a warning that never changes
 *    is one users learn to ignore (#155). So on Stop the report is shown
 *    once per session and again only when its text changes; otherwise the
 *    hook emits the empty envelope and only refreshes QMD.
 *  - Gemini calls it on SessionEnd, whose systemMessage it displays during
 *    shutdown. That is a last chance rather than a turn, so it always reports.
 *
 * Claude Code and Codex are deliberately NOT wired to SessionEnd: Claude Code
 * discards a SessionEnd hook's systemMessage, and Codex documents SessionEnd
 * as advisory and does not surface its systemMessage. Moving the report
 * there would turn "every turn" into "never".
 *
 * Who reads it: a Stop hook's systemMessage reaches the user and never the
 * agent, so the drift the agent is best placed to fix never reached it
 * (#256). On a Stop whose findings changed, the user gets a
 * one-line-per-section summary as the `systemMessage`, and the full report is
 * saved for the session's next prompt, where classify-message hands it to the
 * agent (why that channel: lib/stop-handoff.ts). If the report cannot be
 * saved, it goes out as Stop feedback instead: visible, but not lost (Claude
 * Code; Codex's handling of Stop feedback is unverified, lib/hook-io.ts).
 * SessionEnd and a Stop without a session_id have no next prompt to ride: the
 * user gets the full report.
 *
 * Output is JSON on every agent, never plain text. Codex rejects plain Stop
 * stdout, Gemini's SessionEnd contract requires a final JSON object, and
 * Claude Code otherwise files non-exempt stdout in the debug log.
 * `systemMessage` is the one user-facing field all three agents share. Both it
 * and the handed-over report are held under Claude Code's hook output cap
 * (lib/hook-io.ts).
 * The documented event name is the only branch — no agent sniffing and no
 * agent-specific argument.
 *
 * Under the template's Claude Code mod (#264, lib/om-mod.ts) the mod presents
 * the report itself: it runs this script with `om_mod: "report"` to get the
 * report as data, and flags the Stop it passes down with
 * `om_mod: "standdown"`, on which this hook writes the empty envelope and
 * does nothing else. Without the mod, nothing sends the flag.
