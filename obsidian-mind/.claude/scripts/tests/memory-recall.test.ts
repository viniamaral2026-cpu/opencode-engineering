/**
 * Precision harness for memory retrieval.
 *
 * Builds a synthetic vault covering the real shapes a person actually has:
 *
 *   atlas       iOS app
 *   beacon      iOS app        — same platform, different project
 *   harbor      web app        — different platform, different project
 *   atlas-api   backend        — different platform, SAME product context
 *   drifter     unrelated      — shares nothing
 *   (unknown)   no identity    — an agent with no MCP roots
 *
 * Memories are written through the real writer, so this is a write→read round
 * trip rather than a test against hand-authored markdown: if the writer and the
 * reader ever disagree about a facet, it fails here.
 *
 * Every case asserts BOTH directions — what surfaced and what was withheld —
 * because a retrieval layer is only as good as the things it refuses to return.
 * A false positive puts another project's context into this session, where it is
 * acted on as if it applied; a false negative is a memory nobody benefits from.
