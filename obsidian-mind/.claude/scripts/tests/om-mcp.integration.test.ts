/**
 * The server, over real MCP JSON-RPC on stdio.
 *
 * Nothing here imports the modules directly — it spawns the launcher and
 * speaks the protocol, exactly as a client does. That distinction has already
 * earned its keep three times: a query filter that hid what an unfiltered call
 * showed, a recall that returned a path the caller could not open, and a
 * sanitiser that destroyed every URI in every error message. All three passed
 * the unit suites.
 *
 * THE HANDSHAKE IS LOAD-BEARING. A client must advertise the `roots` capability
 * AND send `notifications/initialized`, then answer the server's `roots/list`.
 * Skip any of it and the caller is anonymous, sees only general-scoped
 * memories, and the result is indistinguishable from an empty vault.
