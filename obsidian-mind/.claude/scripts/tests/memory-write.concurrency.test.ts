/**
 * Cross-process write safety.
 *
 * Separate from the other write tests because the defect it guards CANNOT
 * reproduce in-process: Node runs the synchronous fs calls to completion, so a
 * single-threaded test always serialises them and always passes.
 *
 * It matters because the deployment shape is one server process PER CONSUMING
 * REPO, all writing into one vault. An adversarial run with six processes
 * recording the same lesson title produced FOUR files and SIX success messages
 * — two memories lost silently, which is the worst outcome available to a layer
 * whose whole job is not losing them.
 *
 * The cause was `while (existsSync(x)) bump(x); writeFileSync(x)`: both
 * processes see the name free, both write, one clobbers the other. The fix is
 * an atomic exclusive create, which fails instead of overwriting so the loser
 * takes the next suffix.
