/**
 * Shared helpers for hook-entry integration tests.
 *
 * runScript spawns the hook entry point the same way settings.json does:
 * `node --disable-warning=ExperimentalWarning --experimental-strip-types
 * <script>` with JSON on stdin. The disable-warning flag mirrors the
 * production hook command exactly so stderr-cleanliness assertions don't
 * trip on Node's type-stripping warning (which is unrelated to the hook
 * under test). Used by classify-message.test.ts and validate-write.test.ts
 * to exercise the full stdin → stdout pipeline under the real runtime.
 *
 * hostPath normalizes POSIX-style literal test paths (e.g. `"/Users/x/foo"`)
 * to the host platform via path.resolve. Needed on Windows, where the raw
 * string is treated as drive-relative and pathToFileURL prepends the current
 * drive letter — so a round trip stops matching the literal argv[1] value.
 *
 * rmTemp and waitFor exist because both CI flakes in #235 were assumptions
 * about timing rather than defects in what was under test: a cleanup that
 * cannot delete a temp tree, and a fixed sleep standing in for a condition.
 * Both shapes recur across suites, so the reasoning lives here once.
 *
 * Every hook that writes or stops refreshes QMD through a debounce sentinel
 * beside the scripts. A test that names no sentinel of its own gets
 * TEST_SENTINEL instead, touched before each spawn: the real one is never
 * written, and a sentinel that fresh keeps the refresh debounced, so no test
 * starts a real index update of the checkout it runs in.

 * Cleanup is not the assertion. A temp directory that survives is residue in
 * the OS temp dir, which the OS reclaims; a throw here turns that cosmetic
 * problem into a red build — and does so on Windows, where a handle held open
 * a moment longer than expected is ordinary rather than exceptional. #235
 * lost a passing suite to exactly that, `EPERM` out of an `after` hook.
 *
 * Retries first, because a handle race usually clears in milliseconds, then
 * gives up **loudly**. A test that needs the removal to have SUCCEEDED must
 * assert on it, not rely on this throwing.
 *
 * **The report is the point of the swallow being acceptable at all.** Before
 * this, a held handle turned CI red: a bad test result, and also a real signal
 * that something outlives the suite. Silently swallowing it keeps the build
 * honest and takes the signal away, leaving the open question of what holds the
 * handle on Windows with nothing feeding it. So the failure is recorded and
 * announced at exit instead: green stays green, and the handle holder keeps
 * naming itself until someone fixes it properly.
 *
 * The `errno` code travels with the path because that is the question the
 * report exists to answer. `EPERM` and `EBUSY` mean a live handle; `EACCES`
 * means permissions and is a different bug with a different owner.
