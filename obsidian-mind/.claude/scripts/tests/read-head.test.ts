/**
 * Reading only the head of a file.
 *
 * This replaced `readFileSync(f, "utf8").slice(0, n)` on every hot path that
 * only wanted frontmatter, so the bar is EQUIVALENCE rather than merely
 * plausibility: every test that matters compares
 * against what the old expression returned for the same bytes. A prefix that is
 * subtly different would change which notes count as private, what descriptions
 * a listing carries, and which aliases resolve — all silently.
