/**
 * #304: the eager layer degrades by levels, not all-or-nothing.
 *
 * Before, `applyInjectionBudget` collapsed sections worst-first and stopped at
 * the first fit, with nothing between a whole section and its pointer. A long
 * North Star could not fit whole, so after the file listing and brain index
 * were given up — though they fitted — it collapsed too: 0.4 kB injected of a
 * 9.1 kB budget, and no goals. These pin the ladder that replaced it.
