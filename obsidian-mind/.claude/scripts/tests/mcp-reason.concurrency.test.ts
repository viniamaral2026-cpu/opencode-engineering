/**
 * Cross-process safety for the two files a `reason` call writes.
 *
 * Separate from the other reason tests for the reason `memory-write.concurrency`
 * is separate: the defects here CANNOT reproduce in-process. Node runs the
 * synchronous fs calls to completion, so a single-threaded test serialises them
 * and always passes — which is exactly how both of these survived a full
 * `/simplify` round.
 *
 * They became reachable when the spawn went async. While `runReasoning` used
 * `spawnSync` the whole event loop was held for the child's lifetime, so two
 * `reason` calls could never overlap and neither race existed. Making the server
 * responsive during a spawn — the right fix — opened both windows. The
 * deployment shape widens them further: one server process PER CONSUMING REPO,
 * all writing into one vault.
 *
 * 1. THE RECORD. Named from a millisecond-precision ISO stamp, which reads as
 *    collision-proof and is not. Under a plain write the loser silently
 *    overwrote the winner while both reported success — the same shape that made
 *    six processes produce four memories.
 *
 * 2. THE ISOLATED MCP CONFIG. A FIXED path rewritten on every call. A plain
 *    write truncates first, so a concurrent call can empty the file while
 *    another spawn's child is reading it — and what that child is reading is the
 *    recursion guard, the only thing stopping a spawn tree that multiplies at
 *    every level.
