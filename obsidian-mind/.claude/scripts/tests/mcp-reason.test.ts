/**
 * `reason` — the pure parts: config, prompt, argv, refusals, records.

 * Nothing here spawns. Splitting the decisions out from the spawn is what lets
 * every one of them be driven by a test without starting a session to check it.
 *
 * The CLI facts pinned below were measured against the real binary first, and
 * every one of them contradicted the obvious guess:
 *   - `--max-turns` does not exist
 *   - `--model haiku` silently runs sonnet, so an alias is dropped, not passed
 *   - `--permission-mode plan` writes outside the vault AND rewrites the task as
 *     "produce a plan", losing the answer — so the toolset is restricted instead
 *   - an empty seed reads as evidence of absence unless the prompt says not to
 *   - an early end returns an EMPTY result, so there is nothing to mistake for
 *     an answer
