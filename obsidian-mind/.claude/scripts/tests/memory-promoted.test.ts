/**
 * Serving a promoted lesson through the capture that still declares its reach.
 *
 * Three properties carry the design and each is asserted directly:
 *
 *   - serving is OPT-IN: a marker without an anchor is named and never served,
 *     so every capture promoted before this existed keeps its old behaviour;
 *   - the exposure policy still bounds the read, because this is the first time
 *     `recall` reaches outside the memory root; and
 *   - a stale anchor DEGRADES to the capture rather than widening to the whole
 *     note — returning a `Gotchas` note because one bullet was promoted is the
 *     failure this mechanism exists to avoid.
 *
 * > **The fixture policy is deliberately realistic, and the first version was
 * > not.** It used `["brain", "projects"]`, and every test passed against an
 * > exposure check that compared only the FIRST path segment — so the suite
 * > could not see that the shipping `vault-manifest.json` declares
 * > `work/active/`, `perf/brag/` and `org/people/`, none of which a
 * > first-segment match can ever admit. A fixture that does not model the
 * > production shape cannot fail on it. `POLICY` below therefore carries a
 * > multi-segment root, a `neverExpose` entry, and the suite exercises a
 * > `private`-tagged note and a symlink.
