/**
 * The exposure policy, across every surface.
 *
 * The failure this suite is shaped around is a SECOND read path that skips the
 * check the first one applies — a surface that walks the vault itself instead of
 * resolving through `visibleFiles`, and so ignores the configured roots.
 *
 * So the sharpest tests here assert that the surfaces AGREE: a note absent from
 * one is absent from all of them. A per-surface suite passes even when they have
 * drifted apart, which is exactly the state worth catching.
