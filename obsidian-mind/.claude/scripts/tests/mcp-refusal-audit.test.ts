/**
 * A refusal has to leave a trace.
 *
 * Every `audit(...)` call sat on a success path, so the log answered "what did
 * this repo read and write" and could not answer "what did it try and fail to
 * do". That is the question a refusal loop needs, and it matters most for the
 * markup refusal, which is NOT self-correcting: its trigger is a serialization
 * failure in the caller's own arguments, so a caller that re-sends the same
 * content hits it again. Such a loop was invisible in the log, and the only
 * artefact left behind was whatever the caller did instead.
 *
 * Driven through the real `tools/call` dispatch with a duck-typed session, so
 * these assert the wiring rather than a helper in isolation. A test that only
 * checked the success path would have passed throughout the old behaviour,
 * which is exactly how the gap survived.
