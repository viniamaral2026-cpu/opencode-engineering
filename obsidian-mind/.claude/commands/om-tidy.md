# /om-tidy

The acting half of the hygiene system. The SessionStart and Stop hooks (SessionEnd on Gemini) and the PostToolUse write-time flags DETECT drift; this command ACTS on it. Run on demand, during wrap-up when flags are present, or when the flag list has visibly piled up. Stop fires after every response, so it shows its findings once per session and again only when they change, rather than repeating them every turn.

## Hard rails (safe by construction)

- **Never delete.** Reorganization is `git mv` + splits with verbatim content moves. Zero content loss.
- **Never commit.** Git sync stays the user's call — leave the working tree for review.
- **Judgment calls get flagged, not executed.** Anything ambiguous (does this cluster share real context? is this note's status actually done?) is listed for the user instead of acted on.

## The mechanical tier (act on these)

Work through the current hygiene flags in order:

1. **Completed-not-archived** — `git mv` from `work/active/` to `work/archive/YYYY/`; clusters keep their folder (mirror the grouping); update `work/Index.md`. Same semantics as `/om-project-archive` — use it for anything with ceremony.
2. **Ungrouped clusters** — when the loose notes genuinely share context (judge, don't trust token overlap): create `work/active/<Topic>/`, `git mv` the members in.
3. **Oversized notes (25KB+)** — SPLIT, never trim: move whole sections verbatim into domain notes, event-log satellites, or an archive note; leave a one-liner index behind in the original; retarget links that pointed at the moved sections. **Retarget `promoted:` markers too**: they live in `memories/`, not in the note being split, so nothing in view shows them — `grep -rn "promoted:.*<Note name>#" memories/` finds every capture whose promoted block moved, and each must name the block's new note. A split orphans them silently otherwise; `tests/vault-promoted.test.ts` fails until every anchored marker resolves. `*Archive*` names are exempt by design. A split is complete only when the new notes are wired into the graph — search each new note's concepts (QMD when available) and link what surfaces.
4. **Index drift, orphans, broken links** — new notes must be linked from at least one note; fix wikilinks broken by any moves this pass made; update `work/Index.md` / `org/People & Context.md` / `perf/Brag Doc.md` as touched.
5. **Semantic-linking pass** — for notes created or split this pass, `qmd query` their core concepts (index name from `vault-manifest.json`) and add the links the graph is missing.
6. **Memory-inbox promotion (`memories/YYYY/MM/`)** — durable captures get copied into the right `brain/` topic note. **Promotion is ADDITIVE: copy, never move.** `recall` reaches `brain/` only *through* a capture, so deleting one removes the lesson from every repo that cannot read `brain/` at all — which is the whole audience it was written for.

   Then mark the capture so the flag can fall, and **anchor the marker**:

   ```yaml
   promoted: "brain/Gotchas - Engineering#^om-a1b2c3"
   ```

   Give the promoted block an Obsidian block id and point the marker at it. That anchor is what lets `recall` serve the *corrected* text to a foreign repo instead of the capture as first written — see `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

   Both placements Obsidian produces are accepted: **`^om-a1b2c3` at the end of the bullet or paragraph, preceded by a space**, or **alone on the line directly after it** (which is what Obsidian generates for tables and callouts). The space matters — `text^om-a1b2c3` does not resolve, and reports as a stale anchor rather than as a typo.

   A **heading** anchor (`#Some Section`) works where a block id is overkill. It matches case-insensitively with whitespace collapsed, and returns the section body *without* the heading line, up to the next heading of the same or higher level.

   Two limits worth knowing before you point at one. A **level-1** heading is refused — in this vault's shape the H1 is the note's own title, so `#Some Note` would address the whole note through an anchor that looks specific, and it reports as a stale anchor instead. And what an anchor serves is **capped**, at 40 lines or 8,000 characters, whichever bites first; the caller is told when it did. Point at an `##` or deeper, and at something that reads whole in well under a screenful.

   **The anchor is opt-in and deliberate.** A bare `promoted: brain/Note` still marks the capture and still clears the flag, but serves nothing — the caller is only told a corrected version exists and where. Two things to check before adding one:

   - **The block reads correctly on its own to someone outside this vault**, because that block, and nothing around it, is what they receive.
   - **The target note is one the server actually serves.** A note tagged `private`, one withheld by `mcp_never_expose`, or one outside the exposed roots refuses the anchor — the capture body is served instead and the caller is told why. Anchoring into such a note is not a leak, it is a no-op.

   Never edit a capture's body, `scope` or `confidence`. The marker is the one edit allowed.

## The report tier (list, never act)

- **Open loops** — the stale follow-up flags from the hygiene scan. Chasing, closing, or parking a follow-up is the user's judgment; list them with paths + counts and move on.
- **Competency evidence freshness** — for each `perf/competencies/*.md`, count inbound links from notes modified this half (grep/QMD backlinks + mtime). Competencies with ZERO fresh evidence this half get listed — months of lead time to generate the missing evidence beats discovering thinness at review season. Report only; what counts as evidence is review judgment.
- Any judgment calls deferred from the mechanical tier.

## Report

Write `thinking/YYYY-MM-DD-tidy-report.md`: actions taken (moves, splits, links), flags cleared, judgment calls deferred, open loops listed. Keep it compact — the report is a receipt, not an essay. Delete it once its findings are resolved (thinking/ is a scratchpad by contract).

## Headless subset

`node --experimental-strip-types .claude/scripts/tidy-fix.ts [--apply]` runs the DETERMINISTIC subset from cron with no agent: archives completed work, migrates misplaced memory files (copy → regenerate index → verify → remove), and refuses every judgment class with a pointer back here. Dry-run by default.
