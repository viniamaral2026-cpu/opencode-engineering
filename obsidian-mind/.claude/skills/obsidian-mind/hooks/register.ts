/**
 * obsidian-mind's Claude Code mod (#262).
 *
 * The vault's settings hooks stay the engine: Codex and Gemini run them, and
 * so does Claude Code wherever this mod does not load (an older CLI, an
 * untrusted folder, a session launched in a vault subfolder, a policy that
 * allows only managed mods). This mod changes how their output reaches the
 * session, never what it says: it runs the vault's own scripts and delivers
 * the result through a better channel.
 *
 * Session context (#265): `session-start.ts` runs here with
 * `om_mod: "deliver"`, and its output becomes an instruction file instead of
 * hook output. Unlike hook output it is not cut at 10,000 characters, it is
 * re-read whole after compaction and `/clear` instead of shrinking to a
 * pointer, and general-purpose subagents receive it.
 *
 * Stop report (#266): `stop-checklist.ts` runs here with `om_mod: "report"`.
 * When the findings changed, the user sees one line under the answer and the
 * agent gets the full report with the next prompt, unseen. A finding marked
 * urgent gets a turn of its own at once.
 *
 * The switch is the event itself: the settings hook is passed
 * `om_mod: "standdown"` and exits, but only on an event this hook actually
 * handled. The work is done before `next`, so if it fails the hook throws,
 * Claude Code skips it, and the settings hook gets the original event and
 * runs as it would without the mod.
 *
 * What the hooks hand each other lives in `$.state`, not in module
 * variables: the host keeps it for the session, across a hot reload.
