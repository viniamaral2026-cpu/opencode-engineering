## OpenCode-Specific Features

OpenCode provides additional features you can combine with agentsys commands:

### File Includes with `@`

Include file contents in your prompt:

```bash
opencode
> /audit-project @src/main.py @tests/test_main.py
```

This adds the file contents to the context before running the review.

### Bash Output with `!`

Include bash command output:

```bash
opencode
> /deslop apply !git diff --name-only
```

This runs `git diff --name-only` and includes the output in the prompt.

### Combined Usage

```bash
opencode
> /next-task @PLAN.md !gh issue list
```

Analyzes tasks with PLAN.md content and current GitHub issues.

2. Check installation: `ls ~/.config/opencode/commands/`
3. Re-run installer

### Commands only work in TUI

Currently, OpenCode slash commands are only available in the TUI (Terminal User Interface), not from the CLI directly. Feature request exists to add CLI support.

### Path errors
Re-run installer to fix path substitutions:
```bash
agentsys --tool opencode
```

### Node.js not found
Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed:
```bash
node --version  # Should be v18.0.0 or higher
```

### GitHub CLI authentication
```bash
gh auth login
gh auth status
```
