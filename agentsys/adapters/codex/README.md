## Installation Details

The installer:
1. Writes each plugin command to `~/.codex/skills/<command>/SKILL.md`, with Codex frontmatter and plugin paths pointing at `~/.agentsys/plugins/<plugin>/`
2. Copies each plugin skill directory whole to `~/.codex/skills/<skill>/` (`references/`, `scripts/`), unless a command already has that name
3. Leaves the plugins themselves, with their `lib/` and `scripts/`, in `~/.agentsys/plugins/`

### File Structure

```
~/.codex/skills/
├── next-task/SKILL.md          # from commands/next-task.md
├── ship/SKILL.md
├── ...
├── drift-analysis/             # a plugin skill directory
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   └── references/
└── ...

~/.agentsys/plugins/<plugin>/   # what the skills point at
```

---

## Usage Examples

## Codex-Specific Notes

### Custom Prompt Integration

These commands integrate with Codex's custom prompt system. You can also create shortcuts by adding to your Codex config.

### Multi-Agent Differences

Codex CLI may handle multi-agent workflows differently than Claude Code. Commands will adapt to available capabilities.

### Built-in Commands

Use alongside Codex's built-in commands:
- `/diff` - View Git diff
- `/review` - Codex's native review
- `/compact` - Summarize conversation
- `/model` - Switch models

agentsys commands complement these.
