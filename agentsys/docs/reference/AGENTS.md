# Agent Reference

Every agent in the AgentSys plugins at the commits pinned in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. Each plugin repo's `agents/*.md` is the source of truth; this page summarizes it.

<!-- GEN:START:agents-counts -->
**TL;DR:** 49 agents across 24 plugins (16 have agents). Each agent names a model family (opus, sonnet, haiku; currently Opus 5.5, Sonnet 5.5, Haiku 4.5) or inherits the caller's model, and does one thing. <!-- AGENT_COUNT_TOTAL: 49 -->
<!-- GEN:END:agents-counts -->

Related: [/next-task Workflow](../workflows/NEXT-TASK.md) shows how the agents work together; [/ship Workflow](../workflows/SHIP.md) covers CI and merge.

## Overview

| Model | Resolves to | Used for |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| opus | Claude Opus 5.5 | Judgment where errors compound into later phases |
| sonnet | Claude Sonnet 5.5 | Structured analysis and validation, most agents |
| haiku | Claude Haiku 4.5 | Mechanical work with no judgment |
| inherit | the caller's model | Agents with no `model` key |

Family aliases resolve to the current model in that family, so agent files do not pin versions.

- **File-based agents** (39): `agents/*.md` with frontmatter in each plugin repo. <!-- AGENT_COUNT_FILE_BASED: 39 -->
- **Role-based agents** (10): audit-project review passes, spawned through Task with a pass-specific prompt. <!-- AGENT_COUNT_ROLE_BASED: 10 -->

Plugins with no agents: gate-and-ship (commands only); banthis, skill-curator, system-prompt-curator and agnix (skill and command only); mojo and ada-spark (skills only); zig-lsp (LSP config only).

Tool lists are abbreviated: `Bash(git, gh)` means `Bash(git:*), Bash(gh:*)`.

## next-task Plugin Agents

| Agent | Model | Tools | What it does |
|-------|-------|-------|--------------|
| task-discoverer | sonnet | Skill, Read, Grep, Bash(gh, glab, git) | Fetches, filters and scores tasks from the configured source and returns the top 5. |
| worktree-manager | haiku | Bash(git), Read | Creates an isolated worktree and feature branch for the selected task. Does not claim the task (the orchestrator does) or remove worktrees. |
| exploration-agent | sonnet | Read, Glob, Grep, Bash(git) | Finds the files to change, patterns to follow, dependencies and risks, and returns a report the planner uses without re-exploring. |
| planning-agent | inherit | Read, Glob, Grep, Bash(git) | Turns the exploration report into a JSON implementation plan for the user to approve. |
| implementation-agent | inherit | Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash(git, npm, node), LSP | Implements the approved plan with tests as local commits. Does not push, open a PR or run review agents: `/ship` owns the push. |
| simple-fixer | haiku | Read, Edit, Bash(git) | Applies a precomputed list of mechanical edits (remove line, replace text, insert line) from deslop or sync-docs and commits them. |
| ci-monitor | haiku | Bash(gh, git), Read, Task | Blocks on `gh pr checks --watch` with the whole wait bounded to 30 minutes, reports failing checks and review feedback, and hands fixes to ci-fixer for at most 5 rounds. Reports `passed`, `failed`, `timeout` or `no-checks`; does not reply to reviewers or merge. |
| ci-fixer | sonnet | Bash(git, npm), Read, Edit, Grep, Glob | Fixes one CI failure or one review comment that needs a code change, commits it and pushes the PR branch. |

## prepare-delivery Plugin Agents

|-------|-------|-------|--------------|
| prepare-delivery-agent | inherit | Bash(git, npm, node, agnix), Skill, Task, Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep, AskUserQuestion | Runs the pre-ship gates (deslop, config lint, review loop, delivery validation, docs sync) and returns a `PREPARE_DELIVERY_RESULT` block. Local only; never pushes. |
| test-coverage-checker | sonnet | Bash(git, node), Skill, Read, Grep, Glob | Checks that changed code has tests that exercise it, not just a test file with a matching name. Advisory and read-only. |
| delivery-validator | sonnet | Skill, Bash(git, npm, node, cargo, go, pytest, make), Read, Grep, Glob | Decides whether a reviewed branch is ready to ship: tests, build, requirements and review status. Returns approval or fix instructions. |

| agent-enhancer | inherit | Edit, Bash(git) | Agent definitions: frontmatter, tools, model choice, prompt quality |
| claudemd-enhancer | inherit | Edit, Bash(git) | CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md: broken references, bloat, instructions that no longer help |
| docs-enhancer | sonnet | Edit, Bash(git) | Documentation: broken links, structure, retrieval readiness |
| prompt-enhancer | inherit | Edit, Bash(git) | Prompt files: clarity, dated patterns, output contracts |
| hooks-enhancer | sonnet | Edit | Hook configs and scripts: safety, exit codes, timeouts |
| skills-enhancer | inherit | Edit | SKILL.md files: trigger quality, invocation control, tool scope, size |
| cross-file-enhancer | sonnet | Bash(git) | Consistency across agents, skills and commands: undeclared tools, missing agent references, duplicated or contradictory rules |

## audit-project Plugin Agents

Role-based: `/audit-project` spawns one subagent per pass with the pass's prompt from `commands/audit-project-agents.md` (a `general-purpose` agent in Claude Code), or runs the passes in sequence without Task. `--domain <name>` runs one pass.

| performance | performance-engineer | always | N+1 queries, blocking calls in async paths, hot-path waste, leaks |
| test-coverage | test-quality-guardian | always (skipped with no test runner) | Untested code, missing edge cases, weak assertions, mock fit |
| architecture | architecture-reviewer | more than 50 files, or 3+ repo-intel slop targets | Ownership, dependency direction, cross-layer coupling |
