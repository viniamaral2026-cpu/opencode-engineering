# Installation Guide

One codebase works across five platforms - Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex CLI, Cursor, and Kiro. Install once, get the same workflows everywhere. State files adapt automatically to each platform's conventions.

## Claude Code (Recommended)

Add the marketplace and install plugins directly in Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add agent-sh/agentsys
/plugin install next-task@agentsys
/plugin install ship@agentsys
/plugin install deslop@agentsys
/plugin install audit-project@agentsys
/plugin install drift-detect@agentsys
/plugin install repo-intel@agentsys
/plugin install enhance@agentsys
/plugin install perf@agentsys
/plugin install sync-docs@agentsys
/plugin install learn@agentsys
/plugin install consult@agentsys
/plugin install debate@agentsys
```

**Scopes** (optional):
```bash
# User scope (default) - available in all projects
/plugin install next-task@agentsys

# Project scope - shared with team
/plugin install next-task@agentsys --scope project
```

---

## All Platforms (npm Global Install)

Interactive installer for Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex CLI, Cursor, and Kiro:

```bash
npm install -g agentsys@latest
agentsys
```

Select one or more platforms when prompted:
```
Which platforms do you want to install for?

  1) Claude Code
  2) OpenCode
  3) Codex CLI

Your selection: 1 2
```

### Non-Interactive Installation

Use flags for CI/scripts or when you know what you want:

```bash
# Single tool
agentsys --tool claude
agentsys --tool opencode
agentsys --tool codex

# Multiple tools
agentsys --tools "claude,opencode"
agentsys --tools claude,opencode,codex
```

### CLI Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--tool <name>` | Install for single tool (claude, opencode, codex, cursor, kiro) |
| `--tools <list>` | Install for multiple tools (comma-separated) |
| `--development`, `--dev` | Development mode: install directly to ~/.claude/plugins |
| `--no-strip`, `-ns` | Include model specifications (stripped by default) |
| `--remove` | Remove local installation |
| `--version`, `-v` | Show version |
| `--help`, `-h` | Show help |

### Model Stripping

By default, model specifications (sonnet/opus/haiku) are stripped from agents when installing for OpenCode. This prevents errors when the target platform doesn't have the same model mappings configured.

Use `--no-strip` or `-ns` to include models if your OpenCode setup has proper model aliases.

**Commands:**
```bash
npm update -g agentsys       # Update
npm uninstall -g agentsys    # Remove npm package
agentsys --remove            # Clean up configs
```

---

## Alternative Installation Methods

### Development Mode (Claude Code)

For testing RC versions or local changes, use development mode:

```bash
agentsys --development
```

This bypasses the marketplace and installs plugins directly to `~/.claude/plugins/`. To revert to the marketplace version:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/*@agentsys
agentsys --tool claude
```

### Local Development (Plugin Directory)

Plugins now live in standalone repos. To load a plugin locally, clone its repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agent-sh/next-task.git
claude --plugin-dir ./next-task
```

### Quick Dev Install (Contributors)

For contributors: install to all tools at once from local source:

```bash
node scripts/dev-install.js           # Install to all tools
node scripts/dev-install.js claude    # Install to Claude only
node scripts/dev-install.js --clean   # Remove all installations
```

This script uses local source files (not npm package), installs Claude in development mode, and strips models from OpenCode agents.

### OpenCode / Codex CLI

Use the npm installer (recommended):

```bash
npm install -g agentsys@latest
agentsys
```

Select your platform when prompted. The installer configures:

| Platform | Config Location | State Directory |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Claude Code | Marketplace | `.claude/` |
| OpenCode | `~/.config/opencode/` | `.opencode/` |
| Codex CLI | `~/.codex/` | `.codex/` |
| Kiro | `~/.kiro/` | `.kiro/` |

> **Note:** Codex uses `$` prefix for skills (e.g., `$next-task` instead of `/next-task`).

```

---

## Prerequisites

### Required

## Managing Plugins

### Update Marketplace

```bash
/plugin marketplace update agentsys
```

### Update Plugins

```bash
/plugin update next-task@agentsys
```

### Disable/Enable

```bash
/plugin disable next-task@agentsys
/plugin enable next-task@agentsys
```

### Uninstall

```bash
/plugin uninstall next-task@agentsys

# Or remove marketplace entirely
/plugin marketplace remove agentsys
```

cd path/to/agentsys
git pull origin main
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Commands Don't Appear

1. **Check marketplace is added:**
   ```bash
   /plugin marketplace list
   ```

2. **Check plugin is installed:**
   ```bash
   /plugin list
   ```

3. **Restart Claude Code** after installation

### "Marketplace not found"

The repository must be public or you need authentication:

```bash
# For private repos, ensure gh is authenticated
gh auth status
```

### Plugin Install Fails

Try adding the full GitHub URL:
```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/agent-sh/agentsys.git
```

### "GitHub CLI not found"

Required for `/ship` and GitHub-based workflows:
```bash
brew install gh  # macOS
winget install GitHub.cli  # Windows

gh auth login
```

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Claude Code
- Plugins installed via marketplace are cached locally
- Use `--scope project` to share plugins with your team
- State stored in `.claude/`

### OpenCode
- MCP server provides workflow tools
- Slash commands defined in `~/.config/opencode/commands/`
- Each skill directory is copied whole to `~/.config/opencode/skills/<name>/`
- State stored in `.opencode/`

### Codex CLI
- Uses `$` prefix instead of `/` for commands
- Skills defined in `~/.codex/skills/`: one per command, plus each plugin skill directory copied whole unless a command has its name
- State stored in `.codex/`

### Kiro
- Global: installs to `~/.kiro/`
- Commands become prompts in `~/.kiro/prompts/` (invoke with `@name` in kiro-cli)
- Each skill directory is copied whole to `~/.kiro/skills/<name>/`, references and scripts included; paths that pointed at the plugin root point at `~/.agentsys/plugins/<plugin>/`
- Agents converted to JSON in `~/.kiro/agents/`
- Reads AGENTS.md and `.kiro/steering/*.md` for instructions
- **Note**: Kiro's subagent spawning is experimental (max 4). Workflows with parallel Task() calls (e.g., next-task Phase 9 with 4-10 reviewers) automatically fall back to 2 sequential combined reviewers (`reviewer-quality-security`, `reviewer-perf-test`)

### Skill directories on OpenCode, Codex, Cursor and Kiro
- Each skill directory agentsys installs has a `.agentsys-skill` marker file. A reinstall replaces a marked directory, so a file you add inside one is removed.
- Skill directories from agentsys versions before the marker have none. A reinstall replaces and marks such a directory when every file in it is one the skill ships, which is what those versions wrote (`SKILL.md` alone), so upgrading needs no manual step. Your own skill at a plugin skill's name that is only a `SKILL.md` looks the same, so on OpenCode, Cursor and Kiro, and for Codex command skills, it is replaced too. Add any other file to it to keep it.
- Codex plugin skills are the exception: no version before the marker installed them, so an unmarked directory at a Codex plugin skill's name is never replaced, whatever it holds, unless it is empty.
- Any other directory with the name of a skill agentsys installs (one that holds a file the skill does not ship, an unmarked Codex plugin skill directory, or a symlink) is never deleted or written to: the install skips that skill and prints a warning with the path. To install the skill, move your files out and remove the directory.
- To keep a directory agentsys installed as your own, delete its marker and add a file of your own to it.
