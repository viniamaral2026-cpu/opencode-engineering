# Documentation

AgentSys is a modular runtime and orchestration system for AI agents. These docs cover the architecture, commands, and workflows — how agents compose into pipelines, how phases gate execution, and how state persists across sessions.

**New here?** Start with [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md) to see commands in action.

## Key Concepts

### Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/next-task` | Task discovery → implementation → review → ship |
| `/ship` | Push → PR → CI → reviews → merge → deploy |
| `/deslop` | 3-phase slop detection and cleanup |
| `/audit-project` | Multi-agent code review |
| `/drift-detect` | Compare docs to actual code |
| `/repo-intel` | Unified static analysis - git history, AST symbols, project metadata |
| `/perf` | Performance investigation workflow |
| `/enhance` | Analyze prompts, plugins, agents, docs, hooks, skills |
| `/sync-docs` | Sync docs with code changes |
| `/banthis` | Durable negative behavior memory |
| `/learn` | Research topics online, create learning guides |
| `/consult` | Cross-tool AI consultation |
| `/debate` | Structured multi-round debate between AI tools |
| `/skillers` | Workflow pattern learning and automation suggestions |
| `/skill-curator` | Create and improve reliable SKILL.md files |
| `/system-prompt-curator` | Create and improve autonomous agent system prompts |
| `/onboard` | Codebase onboarding - project orientation |
| `/can-i-help` | Contributor guidance - match skills to project needs |
| `/release` | Versioned release with automatic ecosystem detection |
| `/agnix` | Linter for AI agent configs |
| `/prepare-delivery` | Pre-ship validation checks |
| `/gate-and-ship` | Gated shipping workflow |

### Internal Skills

- `orchestrate-review` â€” Defines review passes and signal thresholds for the Phase 9 review loop

### State Files

| File | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `tasks.json` | `{state-dir}/` | Which task is active |
| `flow.json` | `{state-dir}/` (worktree) | Which phase you're in |
| `preference.json` | `{state-dir}/sources/` | Cached task source preference |
| `repo-intel.json` | `{state-dir}/` | Cached symbol map |

State directories by platform:
- Claude Code: `.claude/`
- OpenCode: `.opencode/`
- Codex CLI: `.codex/`
- Cursor: `.cursor/`
- Kiro: `.kiro/`

### Agent Models

| Model | Used For |
|-------|----------|
| opus | Complex reasoning (exploration, planning, implementation, review) |
| sonnet | Pattern matching (slop detection, validation, discovery) |
| haiku | Mechanical execution (worktree, simple-fixer, ci-monitor) |

### Certainty Levels

| Level | Meaning | Auto-Fix? |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| CRITICAL | Security issue | Yes (with warning) |
| HIGH | Definite problem | Yes |
| MEDIUM | Probable problem | No |
| LOW | Possible problem | No |

## Diagnostics Scripts

When working in the repo directly, you can sanity-check detection and tooling:

```bash
npm run detect   # Platform detection (CI, deploy, project type)
npm run verify   # Tool availability + versions
```
