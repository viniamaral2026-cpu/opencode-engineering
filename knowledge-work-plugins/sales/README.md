# Sales Plugin

A sales plugin primarily designed for [Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork), Anthropic's agentic desktop application, though it also works in Claude Code. It helps with the whole sales day: prepping calls, summarizing and following up, researching accounts, working deals, reviewing pipeline and writing the forecast. It works with the tools your team already uses (your CRM, email, calendar, chat and call recorder) or with files you upload when nothing is connected.

## Installation

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins
claude plugin install sales@knowledge-work-plugins
```

## What's new in 2.0

- **From 9 to 36 skills.** New skills cover deal reviews, close plans, stakeholder maps, renewals, customer health, lead routing, CRM updates, meeting booking, inbox sweeps and team pipeline views.
- **Works across CRMs and email providers.** Skills read your CRM's own stages and fields instead of assuming one vendor's setup, and work the same on Gmail or Outlook, Slack or Teams. No settings file is needed; a skill asks once for anything it cannot find.
- **Uses uploaded files when nothing is connected.** Upload a pipeline export, a transcript or a list of accounts, and the skill works from that.
- **Acts when you ask.** Skills can update CRM records, create email drafts or send email, post to chat and book meetings, within each connector's permissions. Changes a skill suggests on its own are shown to you first, with the evidence behind them.
- **Treats outside content as information.** Emails, call transcripts, chat messages and documents are read as information, never as instructions. If an email or transcript asks for an action, the skill shows you the action before anything happens.
- **Existing skill names still work.** `account-research`, `call-summary`, `forecast`, `call-prep`, `daily-briefing`, `draft-outreach`, `pipeline-review`, `competitive-intelligence` and `create-an-asset` keep their names, rebuilt on the new skills. Two behave differently: `create-an-asset` now builds decks, one-pagers and leave-behinds from your account data rather than landing pages or interactive demos, and `forecast` writes a commit, best-case and pipeline narrative instead of best, likely and worst scenarios.

## Example workflows

### After a call

```
/sales:call-summary
```

Paste your notes or transcript, or name the call if your call recorder is connected. You get a summary, a follow-up email draft, a team summary and proposed CRM updates. Nothing is written to the CRM or sent until you say so.

### Forecast call

```
Write my forecast for this quarter
```

The `forecast` skill reads your open opportunities (or an uploaded pipeline export) and writes the commit, best-case and pipeline story, what changed and where the risk is.

### Researching a prospect

```
Research Acme Corp before my call tomorrow
```

The `account-research` skill gives you a company overview, recent news, likely priorities and fit against your ICP, and checks whether the company is already in your CRM.

## Works with files, better with your tools

Every skill works without any connectors:

| What you can do | With nothing connected | With connected tools |
|---|---|---|
| Summarize a call and follow up | Paste notes or a transcript | Call recorder, email, CRM, chat |
| Review pipeline and forecast | Upload a pipeline export | CRM |
| Research accounts | Web search and your context | Data enrichment, CRM |
| Prep for calls | Describe the meeting | Calendar, CRM, email, call recorder |
| Draft outreach | Web search and your context | Email, CRM, sales engagement |
| Update the CRM | Get a checklist to apply by hand | CRM |
| Book meetings | Get a draft invite to send yourself | Calendar, CRM |

With nothing connected, a skill says plainly what it used and what it could not see.

## Connectors

> To check which tools are included and what else works, see [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md).

| Category | Examples | What it enables |
|---|---|---|
| **CRM** | HubSpot, Close, Salesforce | Opportunities, accounts, contacts, record updates |
| **Email and calendar** | Gmail, Google Calendar, Calendly, Microsoft 365 | Customer threads, drafts, meetings, booking |
| **Call recorder** | Gong, Fireflies, Zoom, Otter.ai | Transcripts and call history |
| **Data enrichment** | Clay, ZoomInfo, Apollo, Lusha, Crunchbase | Company and contact data |
| **Chat** | Slack, Microsoft Teams | Team context and summaries posted to channels |

**Salesforce and Microsoft 365 (Outlook, Teams, SharePoint) are included. Your organization's admin enables each one in Claude before people can sign in; for Salesforce, that includes setting up your org's Salesforce app.**

See [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md) for every included server and other options.

## For admins

Connector permissions are where your team controls what runs. Each connector can allow, ask or block each of its tools, and the skills never go beyond those settings. If a write tool is blocked, the skill keeps working and hands the person a checklist to apply by hand.

For scheduled runs (a morning briefing, a weekly deal signals digest), set send, post and write tools to **ask**, so nothing goes out or changes without a person approving it.
